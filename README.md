# Cache-Side-Channel-on-GnuPG
In this task, I have performed the FLUSH+RELOAD attack on GnuPG cryptography Library to observe accesses to critical functions like Square (S), Module (r), and Multiply (M) function during the encryption or decryption process of the RSA algorithm. <br/>In this project, Gogo will mount a side-channel attack with a goal to leak the critical accesses of Gollu.
